## Blog-Post
Basic Blockpost Project. It includes user registration, viewing information about books, and creating posts related to books. Users can add images, descriptions, titles, and specify authors. The primary focus is on the quality of code, the design of methods, functions, and the overall application architecture, making the project an excellent foundation for further development.
